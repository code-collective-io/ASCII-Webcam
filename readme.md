ASCII Camera
We have designed an innovative ASCII Webcam that utilizes the power of p5.js to convert real-time video feed into ASCII art. Our project was developed by our team of passionate tech enthusiasts who aimed to push the boundaries of what is possible with web-based applications.

Our ASCII Webcam is an interactive web application that allows users to capture live video feed from their webcam and convert it into ASCII art in real-time. The application features a simple and intuitive interface that allows users to adjust the settings and customize the output according to their preferences.
